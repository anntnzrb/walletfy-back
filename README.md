# Walletfy Backend

Walletfy powers the event Tracking experience for the Walletfy platform. It records incomes (`ingresos`) and expenses (`egresos`), keeps totals up to date, and exposes that information to the client applications.

## What You Can Do
- Register new financial events with names, amounts, dates, notes, and attachments
- Browse stored events with filtering and pagination support
- Update or remove previously captured entries
- Monitor service health through a lightweight status endpoint
